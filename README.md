# Some Weakly Supervised Cloud Detection in Remote Sensing Images


## Abstract
In remote sensing applications, pixel-level cloud masks are indispensable in various specific tasks. Consequently, cloud detection is typically categorized as a semantic segmentation task within the domain of RS image
processing. It aims to identify the presence or absence of clouds on a per-pixel basis. However, existing fully supervised cloud detection methods rely on massive pixel-wise annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming.
Weakly supervised cloud detection has recently received extensive attention to alleviate the annotation burden. Here are some reference implementations on Python and Pytorch.
